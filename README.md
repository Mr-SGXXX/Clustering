## Dataset
### Image
- [x] MNIST:

- [ ] Fashion MNIST:

- [ ] CIFAR-10:

- [ ] CIFAR-100:

- [ ] STL-10:

### Text
- [x] Reuters-10K:
  *The Reuters-10K used here is most likely the same as the Reuters-10K used in DEC, which is generated by select random 10000 sample from the [original Reuters](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume5/lewis04a/lewis04a.pdf) with 685071 samples. Because the original Reuters dataset download url in DEC repository is not available now, the total dataset experiment is not possible for now.*

## Experiment Results
### Results Disclaimer
All the experimental results in this repository are obtained based on the code provided in this repository. Due to factors such as experimental environment and parameter settings, these results may differ slightly from those in the original paper. We strive to ensure the accuracy of the results, but cannot guarantee exact correspondence with the original paper.

The possible difference reasons:
- The problem of clustering usually is not stable, the difference of initializing will cause significant difference of results.
- Different hardware devices may cause some different results for their slightly different calculating process.
- The results of some methods strictly depends on some weight from a excellent but rare pretrain try, which doesn't occur all the time, causing the most scores lower than the authors declaimed.
- Some methods don't offer the hyper-parameter setting they used for all dataset, for these methods we use the default hyper-parameter they offered in their code or paper.
- The public code of some methods can not be run correctly for some bugs or outdated APIs. Though we try to fix these errors, it may cause some diffence of the results.  
- There may be some bugs in this repository which influence the score of some methods. If you find any bug, welcome to raise issues or contact me through email.

The hardware environment we used as follows:
- CPU: AMD EPYC 7302 16-Core Processor
- GPU: NVIDIA GTX 2080ti
- Memory Size: 64GB

### Scores Table
Each method in each dataset will be tried for ten times for fair. For deep methods, only the result of the last epoch or the result chosen in a no-need ground truth way will be used. The mean and std shown as the table.

## End
In the end, I would like to express my gratitude to all researchers in the field of clustering and the entire AI community for their contributions. Thank you for their willingness to open-source their code. 

In addition, thank to the github for the copilot assistant which greatly improved my efficence.
